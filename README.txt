This program will give you the quarter mile, eighth mile, 60 foot times, as well as the trap speed.

You need to take a datalog of a pull from 0mph, till you've traveled 1/4 miles
Look for other people with the same setup as your car's trap speed and just go over that speed by a bit.

Convert the datalog to a .csv file and upload it through my program.

The following CSV files in this repository are just for testing purposes.

41.csv features a datalog of my car going 41mph on cruise control
Blank.csv is a blank csv that is designed to throw an error message
test6.csv is a test run I did a while back
